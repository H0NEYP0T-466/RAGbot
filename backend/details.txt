# Database Setup Instructions

## Chroma Vector Database

Chroma is an embedded vector database that requires NO external installation or setup.

### Setup Steps:
1. The database runs directly within the Python application
2. On first run, Chroma will automatically create a `chroma_db/` folder
3. All vector embeddings are stored persistently in this folder
4. No Docker, no external services, no complex configuration needed

### Data Preparation:
1. Place all your PDF and Markdown (.md) files in the `backend/data/` folder
2. The application will automatically index them on startup
3. To re-index after adding new documents, restart the server or call POST /reindex

### Storage Location:
- Vector database: `backend/chroma_db/`
- Source documents: `backend/data/`

### First Run:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys
3. Add documents to `backend/data/`
4. Run: `python -m app.main`
5. The application will automatically index all documents

### Troubleshooting:
- If indexing fails, check that documents are in `data/` folder
- Delete `chroma_db/` folder to completely re-index from scratch
- Check logs for detailed error messages

### API Keys Required:
- **LONGCAT_API_KEY**: For LLM responses (LongCat-Flash-Chat model)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: For text embeddings (text-embedding-3-small model)

### Environment Variables:
See `.env.example` for all configurable options including:
- Chunk size and overlap for document processing
- Number of similar documents to retrieve (k value)
- LLM temperature and max tokens
- Server host and port
